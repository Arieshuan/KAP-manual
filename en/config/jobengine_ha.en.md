## Job Engine HA ConfigurationKAP job engine executes Cube building tasks submitted by user and notify user and other KAP instances when tasks finished. By default there's only one job engine in a KAP cluster, if it fails it can't restore and resume automatically.To enable job engine high availability, additional configuration is required. - KAP job engine high availability depends on Zookeeper real-time monitor and dynamic allocation. So configurations about Zookeeper are required in file `kylin.properties`. Zookeeper is the required by Hadoop and HBase, users can reuse exiting Zookeeper service or start a new one.```kap.job.helix.zookeeper-address=host1:2181,host2:2181,host3:2181``` - Set Zookeeper based job executor in file `kylin.properties`:```kylin.enable.scheduler=1```  - Restart all KAP instances. Job engines are dynamically allocated among all nodes.
