KAP will create a logs directory in $KYLIN_HOME after service started up, which contains log files from KAP.

### Log files
KAP log files are consist of following files;
#### kylin.log
This is kylin's main log file, whose default logging level is DEBUG, rolling by days.
#### kylin.out
This file stores the redirect of standard output of KAP process. For example, echo from tomcat, hive will redirect to this file.
#### kylin.gc
This file stores GC events of KAP JVM. To avoid file overwritten, pid is used as filename suffix.

#### spark_driver.log
(Only for KAP Plus) This file stores output of Spark Query Engine.

#### spark_driver.out

(Only for KAP Plus) The file stores the redirect of Spark Query Engine.

### Logging Analysis

Take query as an example, to introduce how to get more detail information of one query.
Submit a query on Web UI, and tail kylin.log at same time: 

```

* SQL: The SQL statement
* User: The username of submitter
* Success: Whether this query succeeded
* Duration: The duration of this query, in seconds
* Project: The project of this query
* Realization Names: The cube used for this query

### Logging Configuration
KAP leverages log4j for logging configuration. User can edit conf/kylin-server-log4j.properties to modify logging level, log files etc.
Reminder, it's required to restart KAP to take effect.

### Log File Rolling

Log file rolling is supported by configuring kylin-server-log4j.properties. Two rules are applied: "Max File Size" and "Max Files". By default, log4j.appender.file.MaxFileSize=268435456, which means each log file has size limit to 268435456 bytes (256M); log4j.appender.file.MaxBackupIndex=10, keep at most 10 files.
