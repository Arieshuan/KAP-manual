Qlik delivers intuitive platform solutions for self-service data visualization, guided analytics applications, embedded analytics and reporting. It is a new player in the Business Intelligence (BI) tools world, with a high growth since 2013. It has connectors with Hadoop Database (Hive and Impala). Now it can integrate with KAP. This article will guide you through the process of connecting KAP with Qlik.

4. Change the default scripts of "TimeFormat", "DateFormat" and "TimestampFormat" to:

`SET TimeFormat='h:mm:ss';`
`SET DateFormat='YYYY-MM-DD';`
`SET TimestampFormat='YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss[.fff]';`

5. Load columns from KAP to Qlik:

As we have logged in KAP and select the project **learn_kylin** during local DSN configuration, currently we only need to new a query **select * from KYLIN_SALES** in KAP.

![KAPquery](images/Qlik/KAPquery.png)

Export the query results and copy them to the script editor in Qlik Sense Desktop with comma as delimiter. 

![ScriptRunResult](images/Qlik/ScriptRunResult.png)

In the running result, the line count shall be the same as in KAP. In this case, the line count is 10,000.
